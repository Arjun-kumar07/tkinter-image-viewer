This is my second project I have made while learning Tkinter. It is an application that allows you to view images that are in the images folder by the Python file.

## Motivation
In freeCodeCamp's Tkinter course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&t=2331s), I had learnt about using icons, images and making exit buttons. I didn't make an exit button for this application, but I found it straightforward anyway, but I did practise putting images onto the application and changing the icon of the window.

## Tech/Framework
Tkinter - a standard library in Python to make applications with GUIs.

## Installation
- Clone the project via your terminal: `https://github.com/cBridges851/tkinter-image-viewer.git`
- Make sure you have the Pillow package installed. To see which Pip packages you have installed, execute `pip freeze` in your terminal.
    - If you don't have Pillow installed, just execute `pip install Pillow`
- In your terminal, execute `python image-viewer.py` to open it.

## How To Use
- To view images:
    - When the application has opened as per above, you should see an interface that looks like this:
    ![Image Viewer Interface](image-viewer.png)
    - To navigate through the pictures, either click on the arrow buttons on the sides, or press the arrow keys on your keyboard.
- To change the images in the viewer:
    - Navigate to the images folder in the project's directory in the file explorer, and add or remove images!
